Public Radio  / Single Station Radio Rev1 Schematic 

The Public Radio is a product idea for a single-band FM radio. The unit will come packaged in a Ball jar and have only one control - an switched potentiometer that turns the device on and then changes output volume. The consumer would purchase the device tuned to the local FM station that they regularly listen to: for me, it'd be either WNYC or Hot97. Once you buy the device, it will *only* listen to that station. It runs off a 9v battery and is easily transportable, stylish, etc.
